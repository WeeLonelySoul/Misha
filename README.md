# Misha
### A quite so different operating system

## Install
To compile and run the project, you'll need the following installed on your computer <br>
**-> Qemu** <br>
**-> nasm** <br>

When you have these installed just go to the root directory where the `makefile` is located and run `make run`. This will do one out of two things<br><br>
**1) Compile the compilers, sounds fun right? Don't worry it will compile Misha once it's done**<br>
**2) Just start compiling the project, this means that the compilers have already been compiled**<br>


## Misha is being built following:
* [osdev](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page)
* [James Molloy](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/)

Credit goes where credit is due.
