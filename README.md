# Misha
### A quite so different operating system

## This project was earlier known as louOS

### This project is still a work in progress, read the wiki for more info about the project
<b>[Release dates can be found here!](https://github.com/WeeLonelySoul/Misha/wiki/Release-Window)</b>

## Update! (29/11/2017)
Phase 1 is done and will be released on schedule, I'm currently working on phase2 which will be probably be released during the summer of 2018.

Know that the phase2 version will probably not be <b>similar</b> to phase1 in anyway or possible, as I'm rebuilding the operating system from scratch. I haven't yet decided on which filesystem to use. But I'm leaning towards `FAT 12` as it's easier to implement than `EXT2`. I'll add more information at some point
