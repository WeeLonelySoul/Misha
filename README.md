`This project was earlier known as louOS`<br>
`This project is still a work in progress, read the wiki for more info about the project`

*A quite so different operating system*




# Release Schedule

### Phase 1: Release date 22/12 2017
 
* Basic kernel shell
  - Basic commands
    - ksay (kernel say, equivalent to print on *nix  systems)
    - update (Checks online for updates, manually equivalent to bupdate on the system)
    - cv (current version, displays a "nice" screen informing the user about the current version of the OS/Kernel)
    
`Note: More commands will be included in the official release, all commands will be available through the wiki section here on github`

* The ability to "Network update" (still uncertain about how/if it's gonna be implemented or not in this update)

### Phase 2: Release date spring/summer 2018
