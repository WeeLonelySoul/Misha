# Misha
### A quite so different operating system

## Update (04/2/18)
I've decided to change the way how Misha will be released. I'm getting rid of the 'phase' system in fear of pushing bad code/code that could be improved. I'll instead adopt another sort of system, similar to the 'phase' in a way, this system pushes for more updates but not necessarly as big ones. Kinda like how I'm handling [Krul](https://github.com/WeeLonelySoul/Krul) aka pushing small updates and bigger ones as time goes.

This way will hopefully stop the issue of pushing 'bad code', but time will tell. And will make sure that this repository gets more updates.

## Guide
Misha is being built following code/theory shown in the book `Mmurtl V1.0 written by Richard A. Burgess`.
This also means that our code may be similar/same in multiple areas but make sure!! I'm trying to make Misha more of a close cousin than just a carbon copy.

I'll mention it here so everyone can see it <br>
**All the code that exsist within Misha and is the same to what `Richard A. Burgess` has written in the book `Mmurtl V1.0` all  credit goes to him and him solely**
