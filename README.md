# Misha
### A quite so different operating system

## Update (04/2/18)
I've decided to change the way how Misha will be released. I'm getting rid of the 'phase' system in fear of pushing bad code/code that could be improved. I'll instead adopt another sort of system, similar to the 'phase' in a way, this system pushes for more updates but not necessarly as big ones. Kinda like how I'm handling [Krul](https://github.com/WeeLonelySoul/Krul) aka pushing small updates and bigger ones as time goes.

This way will hopefully stop the issue of pushing 'bad code', but time will tell. And will make sure that this repository gets more updates.

## Install
To compile and run the project, you'll need the following installed on your computer <br>
**-> Qemu** <br>
**-> nasm** <br>

When you have these installed just go to the root directory where the `makefile` is located and run `make run`. This will do one out of two things<br><br>
**1) Compile the compilers, sounds fun right? Don't worry it will compile Misha once it's done**<br>
**2) Just start compiling the project, this means that the compilers have already been compiled**<br>


## Guide
Misha is being built following code/theory shown in the book `Mmurtl V1.0 written by Richard A. Burgess`.
This also means that our code may be similar/same in multiple areas but make sure!! I'm trying to make Misha more of a close cousin than just a carbon copy.

I'll mention it here so everyone can see it <br>
**All the code that exsist within Misha and is the same to what `Richard A. Burgess` has written in the book `Mmurtl V1.0` all  credit goes to him and him solely**
### Get the book from [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1588530000/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

#### On top of being built from using the book `Mmurtl V1.0`, Misha is also being built using the guides over at [osdev](https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page) and ofc the credit for any code taken from there goes to them
